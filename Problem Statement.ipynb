Accidents can be prevented by revealing hidden patterns in the data and giving this invaluable data as a warning to the local government, traffic police and the respective drivers of the vehicles on the identified roads.  Also this data can also be shared with Road Design teams who would ensure that future designs are made considering these aspects in the design & construction phase itself.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nData that contributes to determining severity of accident include addresstype, junctiontype, weather condition, Road condition and Light condition. This project aims to predict Severity of accident based on these metrics.\n\n\nThe target audience of the project is local government, police, rescue groups, road design teams, car insurance companies and last but not the least the drivers themselves. The model and its results are going to provide some key insights for the target audience to make impactful decisions in reducing the number of accidents and injuries in their localities.","metadata":{}}]}
